<img src="img/スクリーンショット Top.png" width="35%">

[BLE-MIDI Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NVMLZTTWWVL) is an application that allows you to receive BLE MIDI (MIDI over Bluetooth) on Windows. 
MIDI over Bluetooth LE products, which were previously only compatible with Mac, will also be available on Windows.

[The free trial version can be used without an expiration date or feature limitations. It will be support for the developer, so please purchase it if you like.]

## Features:
- List nearby BLE MIDI devices
- Connection with BLE MIDI devices
- Send MIDI messages from your device to a MIDI port (e.g. loopMIDI)

## Notes:
- Since the connection to the BLE MIDI device is performed on this product, there is no need to Bluetooth paring the OS and the device in advance.
- Only MIDI reception is supported. MIDI transmission to the device is not supported.
- I am not planning to add any additional features to this product. When adding functions, it may be a different product.
